          <h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>
          <p>I'm Jemina, an aspiring designer, who loves all things beautiful and usable. I recently gratuated with a Master's degree in Cognitive Science, which is why I'm now looking for a job where I get to make the world a little easier to use. With my extensive design knowledge and positive attitude, I'm ready to help you make your designs perfect.</p>

          <h3 class="text-muted">Best of both worlds</h3>
          <p>Design is my main passion, but since I have a background in the programming world, I also know how the technological side of digital solutions works. Therefore, I can easily communicate with both designers and software developers. </p>

          <h3 class="text-muted">An artistic eye</h3>
          <p>I have been interested in art from a young age, and I love creating beautiful things — both drawings and designs. My Master's thesis focused on visual aesthetics. In 2018, my design won my faculty's 20th anniversary patch design competition.</p>

          <p>I'm always ready to take on any challenge you throw my way. Once I had to improvise a presentation on the future of AI for young students with a minute's notice. I believe that positive attitude helps you through everything.</p>

          <p><strong>Cognitive Science (MSc) | University of Jyväskylä | 2021-2023</strong></p>
          <p>My strong interest in design and the human side of technology solutions led me to pursue a Master's degree in cognitive science, which focused on human-technology interaction. My studies have focused on human-centered design, visual aesthetics, user research and accessibility. My knowledge about these topics gives me a lot of insight on how to create user-friendly solutions. My studies have taught me a lot about different design perspectives; if needed, I can tell you about the difference between Human-Centered Design and User-Centered Design. I also took courses that discussed digital service design, statistics and cognitive neuroscience. My Master's thesis focused on how novelty and typicality affect the aesthetic appeal of different types of websites</p>

          <p><strong>Mathematical Information Technology (BSc) | University of Jyväskylä | 2018-2021</strong></p>
          <p>I studied mathematical information technology as my major. During my studies I learned programming with different programming languages (C#, Java, JavaScript, React, Python), which gives me a good understanding of web and software development. I also learned the basics of UI/UX design and found myself passionate about the topic. Besides my basic and intermediate studies in mathematical information technology, I also studied mathematics and psychology as my minor subjects. My Bachelor's thesis discussed how to support pair programming communication in education.</p>
