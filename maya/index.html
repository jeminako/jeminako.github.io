      <h1 class="display-5 text-center">The beauty of novelty and typicality</h1>
      <p class="lead text-center pt-3">Today's internet users pay a lot of attention to the aesthetics of the websites they use. According to my Master's thesis published at the Faculty of Information Technology of the University of Jyväskylä, both novelty and typicality affect the aesthetic appeal of different types of websites, but of these two variables, novelty is more important.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Good usability alone is not enough to ensure the popularity of a website in a competitive market where the basic needs of consumers are well fulfilled. In addition to usability, aesthetics has become an essential factor that makes your website stand out from the competitors' websites. Because aesthetic appeal plays an important role in website credibility and user satisfaction, it is important for web designers to understand design principles related to aesthetics.</p>
          <p>In the 1950s, industrial designer Raymond Loewy presented the view that designing the best possible product aesthetically requires finding a balance between novelty and typicality. The theory presented by Loewy is known as the MAYA principle ("most advanced, yet acceptable"). The principle's main message about the importance of both novelty and typicality in terms of aesthetics appeal has been proven to be true in various studies over the years, which is why the MAYA principle is now considered one of the key design principles related to aesthetics. While the MAYA principle has been studied in connection with various objects from shirts to lamps, the research is still lacking when it comes to websites and user interfaces. My thesis aimed to examine how the relationship of novelty and typicality to aesthetic appeal manifests itself between different types of websites. The types of websites examined were commercial websites that focus on selling products and services, and service websites that offer a variety of free services.</p>

          <h2>Method</h2>
          <p>The research was carried out as an online survey using the Webropol program. In the survey, the research participant was shown one image of a website at a time and was asked to evaluate that website using the given nine statements. There were a total of 12 websites in the survey, of which six were service websites and six were commercial websites. The participants were able to answer the research questionnaire with their own smart device. The online survey was opened on January 20, 2023, after which it was open for two weeks until it was closed on February 6, 2023. A total of 108 people participated in the study.</p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Based on the results of the study, both novelty and typicality are connected to the aesthetic appeal of websites, but the connection between novelty and aesthetic appeal is stronger than the connection between typicality and aesthetic appeal. Based on the results, the relationship of novelty and typicality to aesthetic appeal does not differ between commercial websites and service websites.</p>
          <p>The results provide web designers with additional information on creating aesthetic websites. Many websites use familiar design practices, which is why it is essential to think about how to incorporate new and innovative elements into the sites. Based on the research, it is essential to find a suitable balance between new and typical things at any given time - whether you're designing an online store or a service website.</p>
